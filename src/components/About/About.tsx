                I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for back-end development and
                experience in building applications with React, Node.js, and other modern
                technologies. I love solving complex problems and creating efficient,
                scalable solutions. Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to apply my skills
                in a professional and challenging environment.
